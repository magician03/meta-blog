When I first started Web Development, like everyone else, I also wished for an
online Portfolio and super cool blog running on WordPress-like sites. But upon
digging deep into it and spending some time on Web Development, I came to know
about this awesome feature of GitHub, *GitHub-Pages,* where you can host and
serve any number of static-sites for “*free*” with site names like `username.github.io/project-name` . So why not
use this free feature and host a *Personal portfolio* and also a *blog* built
upon *HarpJS* a static-site builder built upon Node that preprocesses the
blog/anything just to *HTML, CSS & JS*.

**ProTip** : *Better to use [Cloud9](https://c9.io/) online IDE for dedicated
work space and testing*

### Getting Started

First, you’ll need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [HarpJS](https://harpjs.com/). 

*Familiarity with Git is helpful, but not a prerequisite.*

Next, head to [GitHub](https://github.com/), create free account and explore the
site.

Done with that ?

Now, open the command prompt. If you’re not acquainted, that’s okay: it’s only
needed sparingly. Now practice some basic syntax for Git and MarkDown( you need
to write your blog in this ) .

```
git init    
// initialises am empty git repository

git remote -v    
//lists out the connected URLs to Github repos

git remote add origin <url>    
//adds a url to existing repo on local machine

git remote set-url origin <url> 
// sets/ modifies the url of existing repo on local machine

git clone <url>             
//create a working copy of a local repository by running the command

git add -A 
//adds or stores the changes

git commit -am "<message>"   
//commit or finalise the changes

git push origin master       
//sync the change with remote-url
```

### GitHub-Pages & Hosting

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/540/1*GCVYwFnJKmbmcgnTkGdPuA.jpeg" >}}

GitHub Pages lets you turn GitHub repositories into websites that showcase your
portfolio, your projects, their documentation, or anything else you want to
share with the world. What’s the advantage ? You don’t need to update your site
every time you modify your sites’ source code. GitHub automatically does it.
*“Everything just works”* . Check out to their video to know what exactly it
does and why I am very much fond of it.

{{< youtube 2MsN8gpT6jY >}}


Ok, so you are now familiar with Git, GitHub, MarkDown, GitHub pages. Now, its
time to dive in.

Go ahead and [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) in GitHub named
`username.github.io`, where `username` is your username on GitHub. Repository
should be public for publishing. Add a license of your own choice ( optional ) .

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/1*KdnHaz650TxADK_qdyRWug.png" >}}
<span class="figcaption_hack">GitHub Repo creation</span>

Clone the Repository to your local system

```
    git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
```
Lets test it now, run the following commands in your Command Prompt or Terminal.

```
    cd username.github.io
    echo "Hello World" > index.html
    git add --all
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push -u origin master
```

You’re done. As simple as that. Now wait for 5–10 minutes. Fire up your browser
and go to 

Yippee, your personal site is now running Live.

### Rules & Best Practices

There are certain rules to be followed while publishing your site on
GitHub-Pages.


- “index.html” file should be at the root of your repository
- Your repository should be made as public ( already done! )
- You can only publish static-sites on GitHub-Pages. ([Static vs Dynamic
sites](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Static-Websites-and-Dynamic-Websites))

While building up your site, it would be a convenient for fellow developers to
explore your repository if you have a good file structure. One good-olden
convention is mentioned below.

```

▾ /
  ▪ styles/
  ▪ scripts/
  ▪ images/
  ▪ index.html
  
```


Make sure commit your project at various stages of development. In case you are
not satisfied with the final output, you can revert back to earlier commits and
start building again.

Next ?

Nothing, for the Portfolio.You are now well acquainted. Start brain-storming and
build an awesome Portfolio to showcase yourself and your projects on *The Web.*

[Here](https://magician03.github.io/) is mine as an example.

### Portfolio Wrap up

Congratulations! You are now done with your *Portfolio *(* *assuming you have
completed all the tasks *:)* and came here )*. *Try to* *make it visible and
reachable from the web, link other social accounts into it. Use Facebook
debugging tools to scrap your site and look into its suggestions.

To change or update it later, at any time, you only need to change the its
repository and changes will live soon.

Next ?

### Blog with HarpJS

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/540/1*U1XJQeMk8_VnONAxntLhXw.png" >}}

I am pretty sure you would be wondering what is this
[HarpJS](https://harpjs.com/) and how does it help us in hosting our blog. Let
me clear these things first, HarpJS is a [static-site
generator](https://davidwalsh.name/introduction-static-site-generators) that
automatically preprocesses code and serves it to the browser as HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript. Now you can focus on writing/blogging instead of wrangling.

( If you are wondering why static-sites instead of wordpress and likewise
platforms, check about it
[here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/11/modern-static-website-generators-next-big-thing/)
)

Head on to Github and create a new repository with the name of your blog, your
final bog will be hosted at `<username>.github.io/<blogName>`. Then ,go to settings, choose your `master` branch as
github-pages site.

I am assuming you have already installed HarpJS as suggested in *Getting
Started* section. So, without further due, lets start building our stuff. Create
and  to an empty folder where you want to create and *initialise* your new blog
over. ( Use Git for version control with remote earlier created repo
remote-url).


```

harp init my-harp-blog

```

This creates a folder named `my-harp-blog`, looks as follows.

```

▾ /
  ▪ _layout.jade
  ▪ 404.jade
  ▪ index.jade
  ▪ main.less
  
```


Now, start your server locally to test it locally using


And go to `localhost:9000` to look at the rudimentary version of your blog.

### [Markdown](https://harpjs.com/docs/development/markdown), [Layouts](https://harpjs.com/docs/development/layout) and [Partials](https://harpjs.com/docs/development/partial)

Just skim through the documentations that are hyper-linked in the paragraph
title above, to get an idea of what exactly they are and what they do.

Each Markdown file in the root directory add a new page to the blog. Go ahead
and create an *About Me* page with contents written in markdownwith file name as `aboutme.md`
.

```

# About Me

Hi, I am Diwakar. I love build cool stuff that helps the world. I am currently an I.T. Undergrad Sophomore in India.
    
```

Now save your file and go to `localhost:9000/aboutme` server running. Yup, your changes are there running
live.

(* Harp does hot-reloading/ live-reloading, so you do not need to restart your
server for every change you make.* )

Layouts are used for establishing repeating structures, whether it’s a header
and footer or something more complicated. The `_layout` file contains this markup. By
convention, Harp doesn’t serve files or folders with an underscore preceding
their name. Essentially, this `_layout.jade` becomes a wrapper for the files that *are*
served.

The content from your `about.md`, `404.jade` and `index.jade` are all brought into the layout wherever you use
the variable `yield`:

Now, head on to `_layout.jade` and make a template for your blog homepage. Here is an example
:

```

doctype
html
  head
    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/main.css")
  body
    != yield
        
```

( *The language used is *[jade](https://github.com/pugjs/pug#pug)*, you can use
HTML also, Jade feels more clearer and easier once you get acquainted and robust
too.*)

Notice that `main.css` is referenced, even though that file isn’t actually in the folder; `main.less`
is. Because Harp has preprocessing built in, there’s no need to have the
compiled files around, cluttering up your app. Update and save the LESS file,
and your changes are already in the browser.

### Adding Articles

You might want your blog to actually have some articles. Go ahead and write a
few posts. I can wait.

Now, I would like to access my first article at `localhost:9000/articles/another-article` , so I’ll create a folder called `articles`
. Folders are for people and so are URLs; make the directory structure mirror
the URL you want.

```

▾ /
  ▪ _layout.jade
  ▪ 404.jade
  ▪ index.jade
  ▪ main.less
  ▾ articles/
    ▪ _data.json
    ▪ a-simple-article.md
    ▪ another-article.md
    
```


There is nothing unexpected going on inside the articles I added, they are just
Markdown. Information about the articles, beyond the articles themselves, is
stored inside the `_data.json` file.

### Flexible Metadata

Keeping metadata inside , rather than inside each individual `.md` file, works well
for a number of reasons:

1.  A file can have any amount of metadata, and it still won’t interfere with your
writing.
1.  Metadata for posts, images, videos or anything else can be added in the same
way.
1.  Different files can still easily make use of this `_data.json`.
1.  The order of information can come from the `_data.json`, rather than requiring anything of
the file name



By adding the title, date, or any other information in a `_data.json` file inside the
article itself, you can get the most out of using Markdown and just worry about
writing.

For this blog, I decided to just add the title in my `_data.json` file for now:

```

{
  "a-good-article": {
    "title": "A Good Article"
  },
  "a-complicated-article": {
    "title": "Another Article"
  }
}

```

Using Jade, it’s possible to iterate over this metadata, listing out all the
articles. I’ve added the following to `index.jade`.

```


ul
  each article, slug in public.articles._data
    li
      a(href="/articles/#{ slug }") #{ article.title }
      
```


As you’d expect, there’s a list of articles on the home page now.

{{< figure src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/720/0*hFs7pLOcISemox_G.png" >}}

This blog is still missing a way to navigate. It would be nice to have the nav
in the footer as well as the header of our layout, so it’s present when someone
reaches the bottom of an article. Harp’s `partial` function makes this possible without
writing the same markup multiple times.

### Partials

`Partial()` brings one file into another. You could use any text-based file in your
application as a partial. Usually you’ll want to bring in snippets of code
rather than entire pages, but you can use `partial()` for either.

As with the `_layout` file, adding an underscore to the beginning of a file’s name
prevents it from generating its own page, which is great for snippets of code.
This convention is true for folders, too: name a folder with an underscore at
the beginning, and nothing inside will be served directly. Folders with a
leading underscore are a great place to store partials. I created a new folder
called `_shared` for this purpose.

Inside  is a new file named `nav.jade`.

```

nav
  a(href="/") Home
  a(href="/about") About
  
```


Now, in `_layout.jade`, I’m using this file with `partial()`:

```

doctype
html
  head
    link(rel="stylesheet", href="/main.css")
  body
    != partial("_shared/nav")
    != yield
    footer
      != partial("_shared/nav")
    
```


Now, the nav can go at the top and bottom of the blog posts without the markup
needing to be duplicated. This is a simple example, but you can probably imagine
how useful partials are once parts of your blog can be reused anywhere.

Sigh !!!

### Going live

Once the initial version of your blog is done, it’s now time to put it online.
Any Harp can be compiled to simple HTML, CSS & JavaScript files, and can be
published anywhere.

```

harp compile

```

This command generates all the required HTML, CSS & JavaScript in  folder in
your blog directory. Now copy the contents of  and put it in another folder,
such that it contains

* index.html of `www` at root
* harp blog directory inside it

Here is the sample view of directory

```

▾ /
  ▪ 404.html
  ▪ LICENSE
  ▪ about.html
  ▾ articles/
    ▪  --// all articles as html pages
  ▪ index.html
  ▪ main.css
  ▾ my-harp-blog/
    ▪  --// your harp blog 
    
```

     

[Here](https://github.com/magician03/blog/tree/gh-pages) is the repo of my blog
as an example.

When you are done with this, now go to the `articles` folder in the root directory and edit all the html’s `href` property as shown below.


```

<li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>
//edit this to
<li role="presentation"><a href="/blog/">Home</a></li>
//another example:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/main.css">
//edit this to
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/blog/main.css">

Do this only for resources hosted by you, do not change the href of the ones hosted by CDNs

```

This is because all our resources are present at `/blog/` instead of `/` for the blog. Now, any idea what is present at `/` ? Your Portfolio’s resources !!!
Now push your to the github repo to be hosted under Github-Pages. Head on to `username.github.io/blogname`

( *To modify your blog later, you first need to modify the harp-blog folder,
then compile it, bring the flattened HTML, CSS, JS to root, edit html files’
href in root folder, push it* )

That’s it. Its a wrap. You are done !!!

*Make sure to comment below your experience, any doubts or for any suggestions.*

Thanks for making it till here. Happy Coding !
